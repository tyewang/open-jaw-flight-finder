# Open Jaw Flight Finder
This simple tool helps you find open jaw flights via Google Flights. This tool will open Google Flights on different dates in multiple new tabs, so you don't have to slowly change and explore each date separately.

## What does open jaw mean?
An iternary is open jawed if the origin and destination is not the same. Essentially, it's a flight plan from A -> B -> C, where A and C are different cities.

## Why would I use this tool?
Let's say you will be attending a wedding in Los Angeles on March 24th, and you want to make a side trip to Mexico City, before going home to NYC. Also, you have a bit of flexibility on the way back from Mexico City. In that case, you'd ideally book a flight from LAX -> MEX -> NYC, and you're probably most interested in the cheapest flight to get back from Mexico City. This tool will help you look up all those flights on those dates, instead of having to manually adjust the dates on Google Flights.
